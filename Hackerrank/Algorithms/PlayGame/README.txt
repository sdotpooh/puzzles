Play Game
You and your friend decide to play a game using a stack consisting of N bricks. In this game, you can alternatively remove 1, 2 or 3 bricks from the top, and the numbers etched on the removed bricks are added to your score. You have to play so that you obtain the maximum possible score. It is given that your friend will also play optimally and you make the first move.

First line will contain an integer T i.e. number of test cases. There will be two lines corresponding to each test case: first line will contain a number N i.e. number of elements in the stack and next line will contain N numbers i.e. numbers etched on bricks from top to bottom.

Output Format 
For each test case, print a single line containing your maximum score.

Constraints 
1 ≤ T ≤ 5 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 
0 ≤ each number on brick ≤ 10^9
