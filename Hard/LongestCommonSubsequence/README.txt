LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

You are given two sequences. Write a program to determine the longest common subsequence between the two strings (each string can have a maximum length of 50 characters). NOTE: This subsequence need not be contiguous. The input file may contain empty lines, these need to be ignored.

INPUT SAMPLE:

The first argument will be a path to a filename that contains two strings per line, semicolon delimited. You can assume that there is only one unique subsequence per test case. E.g.

XMJYAUZ;MZJAWXU

OUTPUT SAMPLE:

The longest common subsequence. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces on each line you print. E.g.

MJAU
